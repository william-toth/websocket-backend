# Websocket backend

Deployed front-end URL: https://notes-with-sockets.netlify.app/

front-end repo: https://github.com/william-toth/websockets-client

back end heroku deploy URL: https://web-socket-backend.herokuapp.com/

Note: optimization for dragging didn't work very well due the structure of my original project (update sends all fields), so still looks slightly janky on the deployed app
